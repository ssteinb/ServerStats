  Want to display statistics from sites like PMC, MCSL or your own custom one? With Server Stats, you now have the power to display statistics from PMC, MCSL, and more! Now with more customizations than ever, you can decide how you want to display the stats. Another new feature is the new sign support with marquee abilities. Yes thats right, you can also display the statistics on signs. If the text is too long for the sign, it will be turned into a marquee. Have statistics/data you want to bring into minecraft?
